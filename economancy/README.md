# Economancy

Koka implementation of the game Economancy.

See https://oflatt.github.io/economancy/ for the game's rules.

## Overview

This repository contains the code for two executables: econ.exe and econ-player.exe. econ is a fully functional graphical version of the card game that can be played against human or CPU players. econ-player.exe is a standalone CPU player executable that conforms to the specification described [here](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~mflatt/cs6525/economancy.html).

## Current Status

The game can be played end-to-end in the econ.exe. The CPU players always choose random moves.
